Develop a machine learning model using 17 clinical features to predict the survival state of patients with liver cirrhosis. The survival states, categorized as 0 = D (death), 1 = C (censored), and 2 = CL (censored due to liver transplantation), will be inferred from data sourced from a Mayo Clinic study on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver conducted between 1974 and 1984..
